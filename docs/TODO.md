# AgentForge — Post-MVP TODO

This list is the output of an independent, adversarial verification pass: ten
sub-agent auditors checked the platform against the Gauntlet Week-3 rubric, plus
a docs-vs-code drift audit. **The MVP passes** — four agents + deterministic
substrate implemented, 115 tests green, verified live against the deployed
co-pilot. Nothing below blocks submission; these are the honest remaining gaps,
kept visible on purpose rather than smoothed over.

## Deferred by design (planned, not built for MVP)

- [x] **Over-time history store + dashboard tab.** Added
  `observability/history.py` — a dual-backend `HistoryStore` that records one
  immutable snapshot per campaign (totals + per-category pass rates). Backend is
  **Postgres when `DATABASE_URL` is set** (durable across deploys; Railway
  injects it) and **SQLite otherwise** (local/tests, stdlib, no new dep). The
  dashboard has a **"Trends over time"** card (`/api/history`) with an inline SVG
  defended-rate line + recent-runs table. Wired into both the web campaign job
  and the CLI `campaign` command, fail-soft. Tests in `tests/test_history.py`.
- [x] **Agent-response visibility tab.** The campaign detail now has an **Agent
  responses** section, tabbed **Deterministic vs LLM-run**, listing each Red Team
  attempt (technique, attacker turn, target response) and each Judge verdict
  (verdict, severity, confidence, model, rationale). Provenance is carried on the
  wire: `AttackAttempt.attack_source` (set by the Red Team — `llm` when the model
  produced the variants) and `Verdict.decision_path` (set by the Judge — `llm`
  only when the LLM actually refined that verdict). Both are additive, optional
  schema fields; `store.agent_responses()` surfaces them via `/api/file`. Tests
  cover provenance in the Red Team, Judge, store, and dashboard.

## Report / schema polish

- [x] **Exploitability field.** `VulnerabilityReport` now carries an explicit
  `exploitability` rating (easy / moderate / hard) derived deterministically
  from the attempt shape (`documentation.py` `_derive_exploitability`), threaded
  into `to_dict`, `_REQUIRED_REPORT_FIELDS`, and the regression case, with unit
  tests.
- [x] **Require `evidence`.** `evidence` is now in `_REQUIRED_REPORT_FIELDS`; the
  deterministic Judge always emits >=1 evidence item on a success verdict, so an
  evidence-less report is rejected by the data-quality gate. Test added.
- [x] **Critical-severity example.** Resolved as *document-only* (Adam's call):
  no synthetic critical finding is manufactured. The `PENDING_HUMAN` gate is
  proven by `test_report_has_required_fields_and_human_gate`, and
  `VULNERABILITY_REPORTS.md` now states this explicitly alongside the honest
  negative (target defended the critical-class attacks). Keeps the findings doc
  real-only.
- [x] **Determinism test.** Added `test_summary_is_deterministic` — builds a
  store, runs `summary()` twice, asserts equal (and byte-identical JSON).

## ATO packet gaps (`docs/ATO_EVIDENCE.md`)

- [x] Added an **SBOM / dependency-version table** (§6, resolved versions +
  deploy-runtime subset).
- [x] Added a **dependency/platform vulnerability-scan note** (§7) — `pip-audit`:
  declared closure clean; base-image CVEs called out as out-of-boundary.
- [x] Added an **incident-response / postmortem section** (§8) — PHI-in-response
  detect → contain → eradicate/recover → review runbook.
- [x] Stated **AgentForge's own dashboard HTTP Basic-auth gate** (`web.py`
  `_check_auth` / `_auth_credentials`) as an AC-3 control row in §3.

## Config, not code (submission-day)

- [ ] **Plug in the LLMs (optional).** Set `JUDGE_BASE_URL` / `REDTEAM_BASE_URL`
  (+ model + key) in env to upgrade the Judge and Red Team to real models. Both
  fail soft to the deterministic core if unset — the platform is fully functional
  without them.
